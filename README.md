# dotfiles

## Description

A collection of several dotfiles for daily used CLIs. I try to minimize what's directly
in `~`, so I put most of my configs inside `~/.config`.

Includes settings for:

- bash (shell)
- mongo (database)
- rtorrent (torrent)
- groff (markdown)
- htop (system)
- irssi (IRC client)
- mpv
- neofetch
- newsboat (RSS client)
- tmux
- zathura (PDF reader)
